***********

Megawidgets are a set of graphical user interface (GUI) components found in use throughout Hazard Services. They provide an easy way for those who are modifying or building recommenders requiring user input to create dialog boxes in order to allow said recommenders to gather information from the user. Megawidgets are also used in other areas of Hazard Services that are configurable via localization: they populate the Details (metadata) section of the Hazard Information Dialog, and they may be used to create GUI components in the Product Staging Dialog for product generation as well.
